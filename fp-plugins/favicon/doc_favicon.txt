FavIcon
=======

FlatPress comes with a complete icon set as part of the standard distribution.
The icon set covers iOS, Android, Mac OS, Windows 10 or higher and classic/ desktop browsers.
All icons can be found in the plugin directory /fp-plugins/favicon/imgs.

If you want to use your own favicon, please make sure that the favicon is a multiple of 48px, e.g. 48x48px, 96x96px, 144x144px (or an SVG file with an aspect ratio of 1:1).
The favicon.ico file should be a multi-layered icon with the sizes 16x16, 32x32 and 48x48.

To display the favicon correctly on mobile Android devices, the path in the site.webmanifest.json.php file must refer to the favicon.
The same applies to Windows 10 devices or higher. The path to the matching icons is specified in the browserconfig.xml.php file.

Google Search, for example, only supports one favicon per website, whereby a website is defined by the host name.
If you activate the FavIcon plugin, a request for the favicon in the main directory will be answered with 307, temporary redirect.
