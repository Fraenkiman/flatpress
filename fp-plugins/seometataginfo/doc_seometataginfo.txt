SEO robots.txt panel
--------------------
Requirement:

$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] must be set in the server configuration file and must not be empty.


Format and location rules:

The file must be named robots.txt.
Your website can have only one robots.txt file, whereby a website is defined by the host name.
The robots.txt file must be located at the root of the site host to which it applies. For instance, to control crawling on all URLs below https://www.example.com/, the robots.txt file must be located at https://www.example.com/robots.txt. It cannot be placed in a subdirectory (for example, at https://example.com/pages/robots.txt). If you're unsure about how to access your site root, or need permissions to do so, contact your web hosting service provider. If you can't access your site root, use an alternative blocking method such as meta tags.
A robots.txt file can be posted on a subdomain (for example, https://site.example.com/robots.txt) or on non-standard ports (for example, https://example.com:8181/robots.txt).
A robots.txt file applies only to paths within the protocol, host, and port where it is posted. That is, rules in https://example.com/robots.txt apply only to files in https://example.com/, not to subdomains such as https://m.example.com/, or alternate protocols, such as http://example.com/.
A robots.txt file must be an UTF-8 encoded text file (which includes ASCII). Google may ignore characters that are not part of the UTF-8 range, potentially rendering robots.txt rules invalid.
