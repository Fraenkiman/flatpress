Newsletter Plugin
=================
 Version:  1.7.0
 Plugin URI:  https://flatpress.org
 Author:  FlatPress

Overview
--------
This FlatPress plugin provides a GDPR-compliant newsletter subscription widget with encrypted subscriber storage, double opt-in confirmation,
advanced email validation (including IDN/Punycode support), DNS caching, and blocklist filtering, all integrated with flexible dispatch scheduling (monthly or staggered batches).

Requirements
------------
-  LastEntries  plugin (required). The setup routine returns an error code if LastEntries is inactive.
-  LastComments  plugin (optional for including recent comments in newsletters).

Static Pages
------------
Customize the following static pages:
-  check-your-email:  Prompt to check inbox/spam for confirmation link.
-  invalid-email:  Message when entered email is invalid.
-  invalid-token:  Shown when confirmation link is expired or reused.
-  throttle-limit:  Message after 3 attempts per day to register an e-mail
-  subscription-confirmed:  Thank-you message after successful opt-in.
-  unsubscribe-success:  Confirmation after unsubscribing.
-  privacy-policy:  Privacy policy
-  legal-notice:  Legal notice

Sample texts are provided in the plugin’s `static/en-us/` or `static/de-de/` directories.

Configuration
-------------
-  Batch Size:  Controls how many emails are sent per day. Default is 30, defined by `FP_NEWSLETTER_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` and loaded via `plugin_newsletter_get_options()`.
-  PLUGIN_NEWSLETTER_KEY:  Uses your blog ID by default for encryption.

Storage & Encryption
--------------------
-  Directory:  `FP_CONTENT/plugin_newsletter/`
-  Subscriber List (`subscribers.txt`):  Each line stores `base64(iv|ciphertext)|UnixTimestamp`.
-  Pending List (`pending.txt`):  For double opt-in; lines are `base64(iv|ciphertext)|token|UnixTimestamp`.
-  Encryption:  AES-256-CBC via OpenSSL or libsodium secretbox. Keys are derived from `PLUGIN_NEWSLETTER_KEY` (blog ID), salted/hashed for sodium.
-  DNS Cache (`newsletter-dns-cache.txt`) & Cleanup Marker (dns-cleanup-marker.txt):  Caches MX lookup results with monthly pruning for performance.
-  Blocklist (`disposable-email-blocklist.txt`):  Stores blacklisted domains and is updated monthly from a remote source to prevent sending to unwanted addresses.

Subscription Workflow
---------------------
1.  Widget  (`plugin_newsletter_widget()`): Displays an email input, privacy checkbox (linking to your privacy policy), and CSRF protection token.
2.  Handle Subscribe: `plugin_newsletter_handle_subscribe()` validates CSRF, email format, and consent; writes a pending entry; sends a confirmation email with a unique token link (`?newsletter_action=confirm&email=…&token=…`).
3.  Confirm: `plugin_newsletter_handle_confirm()` checks token expiry (24h), moves confirmed entries to `subscribers.txt`, purges expired pending entries, and redirects to the appropriate static page.

Unsubscribe
-----------
-  Each newsletter includes an unsubscribe link (`?newsletter_action=unsubscribe&email=…`).
-  `plugin_newsletter_handle_unsubscribe()` decrypts the email, removes the subscriber, and redirects to `unsubscribe-success`.

Dispatch Scheduling
-------------------
All dispatch logic is handled by `plugin_newsletter_check_and_send($dateFile, $subFile)`:
-  Initialization:  Creates `pending.txt`, `subscribers.txt`, `batch-offset.txt`, and `next-send-date.txt` if missing.
-  Monthly Purge:  On the 1st of each month, clears `pending.txt` and resets `batch-offset.txt`.
-  Next Send Date:  Sets initial send for the 1st of next month at 03:00 if no date is saved; thereafter reads and compares against current time.
-  Batch Dispatch:  Sends up to `PLUGIN_NEWSLETTER_BATCH_SIZE` subscribers per invocation at 03:00 daily, updates offset, and schedules the next run (next day or next month).
-  Full Send:  `plugin_newsletter_send_all($subFile)` builds email content with last entries and comments widget outputs, then sends HTML emails with proper headers.
   It now skips subscribers whose domains appear in the blocklist.

Admin Panel Integration
-----------------------
Template:  `admin.plugin.newsletter.tpl`
Smarty Variables:
- `subscribers`:  Array of `{email, email_encoded, date (Y-m-d), time (H:i:s)}` decrypted from `subscribers.txt`.
- `batch_size`:  Current batch size option.
- `batch_pending` & `subscribers_remaining`:  Indicates in-progress staggered dispatch and shows remaining count.
- `newsletter_csrf_token`:  Token for secure POST actions.

Actions:
-  Delete Subscriber:  POST `newsletter_delete` with CSRF token invokes `plugin_newsletter_handle_admin_delete()`.
-  Send Now:  POST `newsletter_send_all` with CSRF token triggers an immediate full send and redirects with success flag.
-  Settings:  POST `newsletter_save_settings` to update `batch_size`, uses `plugin_addoption()` and `plugin_saveoptions()`, then displays success message.

Localization
------------
Text strings are defined in `lang/<locale>/lang.<locale>.php`; the German example is `lang/de-de.php` for translations of widget labels, messages, and admin UI.
